# python
This is a project I started using beginner methods in Python that will calculate a High School students GPA.

Beyond that it can also let Rockhurst students know what honors they are eligible for at the end of semester:
(Ignation Honors -- 4.0 and above)
(First Honors -- 3.600 to 3.999)
(Second Honors -- 3.000 to 3.599)

Addionally, Rockhurst will put both your honors and AP classes on a 5.0 scale as long as it is above a B.

Typically, universal calculators provided online disregard this rule and sometimes hold honors classes on a 4.5 scale.

This makes it difficult for students to accurately know there GPA and I believe many Rockhurst students are mislead
because these guidelines are hidden within the student handbook.
